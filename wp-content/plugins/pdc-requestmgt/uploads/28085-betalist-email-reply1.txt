Hi,

Thanks for joining the Setlr beta list!

I'd love to chat a little about how we can help you grow through translation if that's your goal.

If you like you can start by letting me know what you need to translate and I'll help you get connected to Setlr :)

The good news is we'll be inviting you to login and try the service in the coming days. We'll be offering our beta users a really personal level of service so feel free to ask any questions you might have about the site. The more you can tell us about your needs the more we can help!

Thanks,

Greg

PS. If you're thinking of becoming a translator just let me know.

I'm really sending this email I'm not an auto reply!!
